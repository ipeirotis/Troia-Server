Dawid Skene as a Service

This is a the web service implementation of the code at http://code.google.com/p/get-another-label/ 

The web service code has additional functionality as well:
* Ability to persist the data
* Ability to execute the algorithm incrementally, as opposed to the batch execution in the prior code

The current API works as follows

* getDawidSkene(id): Creates a project with the given id. This is being used to store the data and give the ability to come back later and add/delete entries to an existing project
* initializeDS(id, categories, incremental): Specifies the set of categories to be used for the given project with the given id.
* ....


TODO:

1. Finish the JUnit tests for the individual methods
2. Create an example run, in which we will load the data used in http://qmturk.appspot.com/ into a DS class, and then run it.
3. Create JUnit test that will do the "functional" testing of the application, using the data from (2)
4. Post the code in a public repository, together with documentation of the calls, a small example, and with setup instructions
5. Create a web-accessible demo like the one on http://qmturk.appspot.com/
6. Add Jing's code on quality-sensitive payments
6. Add Jing's code on selecting best action for when a new worker arrives (give gold, give unlabeled, repeat labeling)
